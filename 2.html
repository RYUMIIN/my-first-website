    <h4>Although he uses a unique tone that feels neutral,</h4> he uses his voice to match the right person, creating a unique and dreamy atmosphere that feels like a movie and a musical. Since he personally produces and performs music videos and beats, he emphasizes not only the quality of the pieces but also the quality of the pieces.
Strangely enough, Giorpak's music feels like watching a movie, and it is expected that Giorpak will be inspired by the characters in the movie, including Willie Wonka, who he mentioned as a role model. The ability to create tension and highlights in the song is excellent, and the auditory effect alone can draw a lot of imagination. The result is a new kind of music that is hard to find in Korea. This shows that Giorpak has a high understanding of art.
